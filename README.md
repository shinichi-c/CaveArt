# üõ†Ô∏è Adding New Wallpapers

‚ÄãThe most important feature for development is the automatic content loader. To add a new wallpaper to the app.

- Step 1: Place Your File

Place your image file (e.g., .jpg, .png, or even a .xml drawable) into the following directory:

              app/src/main/res/drawable

- Step 2: Follow the Naming Convention

Your file name MUST start with the prefix wp_ and must follow the format wp_TITLE_TAG. The last word of the filename (before the extension) is automatically used as the Category Tag.

Use underscores (_) instead of spaces.

Full File Name Example:

        wp_golden_sunset_arch_landscape.jpg


# File Parsing Logic

The application will read this filename and generate the corresponding wallpaper entry:
